python is programming language.
This is very flexible language ,we can write programs very easily.

    Python is interpreted
    Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks;
    Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.
    Unlike C, C++ and Java, there is no semicolon in Python.
